**Hibernate :** Hibernate is a Java ORM framework that connects your Java objects to database tables, letting you perform database operations using simple Java code instead of SQL.<br><br>
**Component Mapping :** Component Mapping in Hibernate lets you embed a non-entity class inside an entity. Its fields are stored as columns in the same table, avoiding separate tables and simplifying the design.<br><br>
**Hibernate annotations :** Hibernate annotations describe how Java objects should be stored in database tables, replacing XML and simplifying ORM mapping.<br><br>
**Steps to execute Hibernate codes:**<br><br>
1) Create java project -> add all hibernate jar files and mysql connector jar file to project (right click on project -> open build path -> configure build path -> go to libraries -> click on classpath -> click on add external jars -> and select -> apply and continue)
