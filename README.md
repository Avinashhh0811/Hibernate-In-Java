# Hibernate In Java -

**Hibernate :** Hibernate is a Java ORM framework that connects your Java objects to database tables, letting you perform database operations using simple Java code instead of SQL.<br><br><img width="461" height="272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e2274b8-6270-4efa-b07b-6602d3a25734" />

**Component Mapping :** Component Mapping in Hibernate lets you embed a non-entity class inside an entity. Its fields are stored as columns in the same table, avoiding separate tables and simplifying the design.<br><br><img width="408" height="304" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e84737f-9ce3-4a9f-96c8-1af072dfa45c" />

**Hibernate annotations :** Hibernate annotations describe how Java objects should be stored in database tables, replacing XML and simplifying ORM mapping.<br><br><img width="454" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e7f72c3-62e0-4c90-8800-169a9b7436eb" />
